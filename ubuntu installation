# Installing Jenkins on RHEL 7/8, CentOS 7/8 or Amazon Linux OS
# You can execute this script as user-data when launching your Ubuntu VM
# The target system should be running a recent version of the Ubuntu operating system.
# You will need to be able to access the system via CLI, most likely over SSH, and via HTTP on port 8080.
# You will need to have root permission on the target system, specifically so you can run commands using sudo.
# In a terminal, run the following commands:

wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-11-jdk
sudo apt-get -y install jenkins
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

# Using the Initial Admin Password
# Run the following command and copy the output:
# the path is found when on portal of localhost:8080

sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword


# Help check to know if Jenkins is up and running
curl -v localhost
curl -v localhost:8080

# Take note of address binding when installing servers with same port on a single serve.
# use a different port numbers if it must be done
# Access Jenkins from the browser
curl ifconfig.co 
<public-ip>:8080
